## 📋 Common React Interview Questions

### Fundamental Concepts

#### 1. What is React and why would you use it?
**Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Key benefits:
- **Component-based architecture** - Reusable, modular code
- **Virtual DOM** - Efficient updates and rendering
- **Declarative** - Describe what UI should look like, React handles how
- **Large ecosystem** - Extensive community and tooling
- **Performance** - Optimized rendering with reconciliation
- **Developer experience** - Great debugging tools and hot reload

#### 2. What is JSX?
**Answer:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It gets transpiled to React.createElement() calls.

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

// Transpiled to:
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

#### 3. What's the difference between state and props?
**Answer:**
- **Props** - Data passed from parent to child, read-only, external
- **State** - Internal component data that can change, triggers re-renders

```jsx
// Props example
function Child({ name, age }) {
  return <p>{name} is {age} years old</p>;
}

// State example
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

### Hooks Questions

#### 4. Explain useState and useEffect
**useState:** Adds state to functional components
```jsx
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
```

**useEffect:** Handles side effects and lifecycle events
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic
  return () => {
    // Cleanup
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

#### 5. What is the dependency array in useEffect?
**Answer:** Controls when the effect runs:
- **No array** - Runs after every render
- **Empty array []** - Runs once on mount
- **[dep1, dep2]** - Runs when dependencies change

#### 6. How do you prevent infinite loops in useEffect?
**Answer:**
- Include all dependencies in the dependency array
- Use useCallback for function dependencies
- Use functional updates for state dependencies

```jsx
// ❌ Infinite loop
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
}, [count]);

// ✅ Correct
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
}, []); // Or remove count from dependencies
```

### Advanced Concepts

#### 7. What is the Virtual DOM?
**Answer:** A JavaScript representation of the real DOM kept in memory. React uses it to:
- Calculate the minimum changes needed (diffing)
- Update only what changed (reconciliation)
- Improve performance by batching updates

#### 8. Explain React's reconciliation process
**Answer:** The process of comparing the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one and updating only the changed elements in the real DOM.

#### 9. What are React keys and why are they important?
**Answer:** Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in lists.

```jsx
// ❌ Bad - using index
{items.map((item, index) => <Item key={index} data={item} />)}

// ✅ Good - using unique identifier
{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} data={item} />)}
```

#### 10. What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?
**Answer:** Passing props through multiple component levels. Solutions:
- **Context API** - Share data across component tree
- **State management libraries** - Redux, Zustand
- **Component composition** - Render props, children

## 💻 Coding Challenges

```jsx
// Main components
function Feed() {
  // Manages posts, pagination, infinite scroll
}

function Post({ post }) {
  // Individual post with likes, comments
}

function CreatePost() {
  // Form to create new posts
}

// State management
const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);

// Data fetching
useEffect(() => {
  fetchPosts();
}, []);

// Infinite scroll

## 🧠 Behavioral Questions

### "Why do you want to work with React?"
**Sample Answer:**
"I chose React because of its component-based architecture and strong ecosystem. The declarative nature makes code more predictable and easier to debug. The large community means great resources and job opportunities. I also appreciate how React encourages best practices like separation of concerns and reusable code."

### "How do you stay updated with React?"
**Sample Answer:**
"I follow the official React blog and documentation for updates. I'm active in the React community on Twitter and Reddit. I regularly read articles on Medium and Dev.to. I also experiment with new features in personal projects and contribute to open source when possible."

### "Describe a challenging bug you fixed"
**Structure:**
1. **Situation** - What was the problem?
2. **Task** - What needed to be done?
3. **Action** - How did you solve it?
4. **Result** - What was the outcome?

## 🔧 Technical Skills Assessment

### Code Review Exercise
**They might ask you to review this code:**

```jsx
function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setUsers(data));
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {users.map(user => (
        <div key={Math.random()}>
          <h3>{user.name}</h3>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Issues to identify:**
1. Missing dependency array in useEffect (infinite loop)
2. No error handling for API call
3. Using Math.random() for keys (should use user.id)
4. No loading state

### Refactoring Exercise
**Improved version:**

```jsx
function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUsers = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch('/api/users');
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');
        const data = await response.json();
        setUsers(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUsers();
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {users.map(user => (
        <div key={user.id}>
          <h3>{user.name}</h3>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
