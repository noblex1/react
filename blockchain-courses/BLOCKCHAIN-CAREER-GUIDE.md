## 🎯 Technical Interview Preparation

### Smart Contract Interview Questions

#### Beginner Level
```solidity
// Q: Explain the difference between view and pure functions
contract Example {
    uint256 public value = 10;
    
    // View function - reads state
    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
    
    // Pure function - no state interaction
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Q: What are the security issues in this contract?
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        
        // Reentrancy vulnerability!
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success);
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

#### Intermediate Level
```solidity
// Q: Implement a gas-efficient batch transfer
contract BatchTransfer {
    IERC20 public token;
    
    function batchTransfer(
        address[] calldata recipients,
        uint256[] calldata amounts
    ) external {
        require(recipients.length == amounts.length, "Length mismatch");
        
        uint256 totalAmount = 0;
        uint256 length = recipients.length;
        
        // Calculate total first to save gas
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            totalAmount += amounts[i];
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
        
        // Single transfer from sender to contract
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        
        // Batch transfers to recipients
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            token.transfer(recipients[i], amounts[i]);
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
}

// Q: Design a flash loan contract
contract FlashLoan {
    IERC20 public token;
    uint256 public fee = 9; // 0.09%
    
    function flashLoan(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external {
        uint256 balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(balanceBefore >= amount, "Insufficient liquidity");
        
        // Transfer tokens to borrower
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        
        // Call borrower's callback
        IFlashLoanReceiver(msg.sender).executeOperation(amount, fee, data);
        
        // Check repayment
        uint256 balanceAfter = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 feeAmount = (amount * fee) / 10000;
        require(balanceAfter >= balanceBefore + feeAmount, "Loan not repaid");
    }

    }
    
    mapping(address => mapping(address => Pool)) public pools;
    uint256 private constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10**3;
    
    // Time-weighted average price protection
    function getAmountOut(
        uint256 amountIn,
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut
    ) public view returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        Pool memory pool = pools[tokenIn][tokenOut];

        require(timeElapsed >= 60, "Price manipulation protection");
        
        // Calculate output with fee
        uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn.mul(997);
        uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee.mul(pool.reserve1);
        uint256 denominator = pool.reserve0.mul(1000).add(amountInWithFee);
        amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    }

        delete commitments[commitment];
